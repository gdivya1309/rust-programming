1. Write a program to implement Type Casting Operator.
fn main() {
    let a: i32 = 100;
    let b: f64 = a as f64;
    println!("a = {}, b = {}", a, b);
}

2. Write a program to implement Borrowing and Dereferencing Operators
fn main() {
    let x = 10;
    let y = &x;
    println!("Borrowed value y = {}", y);
    println!("Dereferenced value *y = {}", *y);
}
